***Course Description***
This course will introduce you to neural techniques for speech synthesis (text to speech: TTS) and automatic speech recognition (speech to text: STT/ASR). We start with brief overviews of TTS, ASR, and neural nets, and then turn to specific neural models. The course is theoretical and practical and grading will be on the basis of neural systems that you implement.

I'll assume some familiarity with the content of Ling 578. However, a student unfamiliar with that material, but who makes energetic use of the text, should be fine.

You need to know how to program in python to take this course.
